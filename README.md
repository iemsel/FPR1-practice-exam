# FooBar

PRACTICE EXAM. Manage Foos and Bars

This is the fictitious case of **Foo-Bar**. Foobar is a combination of the two so-called 
metasyntactic variables Foo and Bar. It is a phonetic pronunciation of the US military abbreviation 
FUBAR. FUBAR is an acronym that stands for "Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition" and is used by 
technicians to indicate that further attempts to repair a device or part are futile. In the computer 
world, foobar is often used to indicate an unspecified object or attribute. The designation is used 
when the name or function is not important. If a computer programmer makes a setup as a demonstration 
of a web store, he will probably have it sell foobars.
